                    Hey yall I'm a student at Red River College Polytech in the soon to be gone Business Information Technologoy (BIT). I'm making this site as a way to show off who I am and 
                to show off some of my personal projects !! This site will also be used to show of what I am into and will have a mysterious contact page I need for this web development project
                I am working on!
            </p>

            <P>
                My interests include film, music and reading!!
            </P>

                <img src="images/movie.png" alt="NASA logo" id="nasalogo">My last movie watched was Boy and the Heron directed by Hayao Miyazaki. It's a very beautiful drawn movie by the wonderful team at Studio Ghibli. The plot was a little confusing but I 
                was astonished by just how much detail was put into ever frame and the music was fantastic!
            </p>

            <p class = "hasImage">
                <img src="images/album.png" alt="NASA logo" id="nasalogo">My favourite album ever is No Now by Clarence Clarity! It's a very maximal album that ends up blaring you with noise throughout. It took me a bit to appreciate it,
                but now it's become one of my favourites ever.
            </p>

            <p class = "hasImage">
                <img src="images/peridro.png" alt="NASA logo" id="nasalogo">The book I'm reading right now is Peridro Street Station by China Mi√©ville. It's a bit of a read at over 700 pages but I've been really enjoying it so far!
                The setting especially has been really interesting to me, with it being set on a city built on top of the rotting carcase of a giant monster that no one can truly identify.
